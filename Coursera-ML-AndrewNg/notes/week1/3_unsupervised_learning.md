## Overview

In unsupervised learning we approach a problem with little or no idea about what our result should look like.

In unsupervised learning there is no feedback.

There are two major techniques used to describe the data in unsupervised learning:
- Clustering
- Non-clustering 

## Clustering

In this we explore the data to divide it into seperate meaningful groups/cluster. The seperation of data is based on their internal patterns without prior knowledge of group credentials.

**Examples of clustering**

- Take a collection of 1 million genes and find a way to automatically group these.

## Non-Clustering

In this we try to find a meaningful structure in a chaotic environment.

**Examples of non-clustering**

- There are two people in a room and there are microphones. We just record the audio and pass it to an algorithm and tell the algorithm, hey, learn the pattern if there is any. Each individual might have their own speech pattern/ language/accent. The algorithm pick it up on its own such pattern and detect that there are two people in the room and they can distinguish the speeches of the two people.

## Use Cases of Unsupervised Learning

- exploring the structure of the information.
- extracting valuable insights.
- detech pattern.
