# Classification

In classification problems the variable y will be a **discrete** value like 0 or 1.

Here are some examples of classification problem:

- If a particular mail is spam or not.
- If a particular url is a fraud or not.
- If a tumor is Maligant or Benign.

As you can see from the above examples they answer are going to be **discrete** values. So, for first mail example it is going to be yes or no, Same for the fraud example and for the tumor it will be either maligant or benign.  

when we take only two discrete values i.e. 0 or 1.  
*0 will be consider as a* **negative class**.  
*1 will be consider as a* **positive class**.  

so, y &#8712; {0, 1}

Now, In some of the cases for a particular data set the **linear regression** may work for you. But it is not good idea to linear regression as it is not going to work always as you update your dataset.
