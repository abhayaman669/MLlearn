## Overview

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and we already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning can be categorized into two problems:

- Regression
- Classification

## Regression

It aims to model the relationship between a certain number of features and a continuous target variable.

In regression problems we try to come up with a quantitative answer, like predicting the prices of a house or the number of seconds that someone will spend watching a video.

**Examples**

- Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. 
- Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture
- Predicting house price based on area.
- Predict the number of copies a music album will be sold next month

## Classification

It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.

**Examples**

- Whether the house sells for more or less than the asking price.
- Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
- If a mail is spam or not.
