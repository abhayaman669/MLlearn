# What is Machine Learning

Here are two definitions for ML that we will be learning.

- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - **Arthur Samuel:**
- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. - **Tom Mitchell:**

The Definition by **Arthur Samuel** is old whereas **Tom Mitchell** provides more mordern definition of what ML means.

## Examples for ML based on **Tom Mitchell** definition
