# What is Machine Learning

Here are two definitions for ML that we will be learning.

- The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - **Arthur Samuel:**
- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. - **Tom Mitchell:**

The Definition by **Arthur Samuel** is old whereas **Tom Mitchell** provides more mordern definition of what ML means.

## Examples for ML based on **Tom Mitchell** definition

TODO: *Add more examples for this*

```text
Playing Checkers:

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers.  
T = the task of playing checkers.  
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.  
```

Email Spam Filter:  

E = watching a user lable emails as spam or not.  
T = classifing email as spam or not.  
P = the number of emails correctly classified as spam or not spam.
```

## Types of machine learning

Mainly there are three type of ML algorithms

1. [Supervised Learning](2_supervised_learning.md)
2. [Unsupervised Learning](3_unsupervised_learning.md)
3. Reinforcement Learning
